Beta Bank is losing customers every month. Since it's cheaper to retain customers than to acquire new ones, a model was created to predict which customers might leave the bank in order to take preventive measures.

- Data: Customer information, including age, gender, country, banking history, products purchased, and whether the customer left the bank.
- Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn (models, metrics).
- Output: Model trained and optimized to detect at-risk customers, achieving a higher-than-desired F1 score (0.59) and comparative analysis with AUC-ROC.
