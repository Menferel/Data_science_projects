Interconnect seeks to anticipate customer churn to offer personalized promotions and reduce churn. A classification model was developed to predict whether a customer will churn, based on personal data, contracts, and contracted services.

- Data: Contracts, personal characteristics, internet and telephone service usage, integrated by customerID.
- Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy, scipy, sklearn (models, metrics, and others), lightgbm.
- Output: Model capable of identifying customers at risk of churn, helping to design preventive campaigns and personalized retention.
