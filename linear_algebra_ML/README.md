Development of a data transformation algorithm that makes it difficult to recover personal information if it falls into the wrong hands. This is called data masking or data obfuscation. However, data must be protected in such a way that the quality of the machine learning models is not compromised. It is not necessary to choose the best model; it is enough to demonstrate that the algorithm works correctly.

- Data: demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of policyholders, including sex, age, salary, number of family members, and number of benefits received in the last five years.
- Libraries: Pandas, numpy, seaborn, math, sklearn, IPython.
- Outcome: Implementation of predictive benefit models and development of data obfuscation methods that preserve the accuracy of the models while protecting sensitive policyholder information.
