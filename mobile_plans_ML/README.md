Megaline seeks to recommend plans to its customers, rather than keeping them on legacy plans. A classification model was developed to predict whether a user should be on the Smart or Ultra plan based on their monthly usage.

- Data: Logs with calls, minutes, MB used.
- Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn.
- Output: Model capable of identifying the optimal plan for each customer and optimizing migration strategies to new plans.
