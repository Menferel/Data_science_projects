Instacart is a grocery delivery platform where customers can place an order and have it delivered, similar to Uber Eats and DoorDash. The project's goal is to clean the data and prepare a report that provides insight into the shopping habits of Instacart customers.

- Data: Order and product records, distributed across five tables (orders, products, aisles, departments, and items ordered).
- Libraries: Pandas, matplotlib.
- Output: Report and graphs on shopping habits (times, days, most ordered products, repurchase frequency).
