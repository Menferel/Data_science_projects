Development of machine learning models to predict the market value of used vehicles for the Rusty Bargain platform, which seeks to streamline car appraisals in its app and attract new customers.

Data: sales history, technical specifications, models, used car prices, etc.
Libraries: Pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seabonr, math, time, sklearn, lightgbm, catboost.
Outcome: Comparison of multiple regression algorithms (linear regression as a sanity test, decision trees, Random Forest, and gradient boosting), achieving a balance between accuracy, prediction speed, and training time, to optimize automatic car appraisals in the Rusty Bargain app.
