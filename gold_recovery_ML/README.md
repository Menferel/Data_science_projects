The mining company seeks to optimize its industrial process by predicting gold recovery at different stages of production. The objective is to build robust predictive models to estimate both intermediate (rougher) and final gold recovery, using metallurgical process data. The metric used was Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE).

- Data: Physical and chemical process variables collected hourly from three datasets: train, test, and full.
- Libraries: Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, sklearn (metrics and models).
- Results: Selection of the best model with low sMAPE for rougher and final recovery.
