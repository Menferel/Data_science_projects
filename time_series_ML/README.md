Sweet Lift Taxi has collected historical data on taxi requests at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the number of taxi requests for the next hour. This requires creating a model.

- Data: Historical records of taxi requests sampled at hourly intervals.
- Libraries: Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, time, statsmodel, lightgbm, sklearn (metrics, models, and others).
- Output: Predictive model capable of estimating hourly demand, allowing for resource management and maximizing operational efficiency during peak hours.
